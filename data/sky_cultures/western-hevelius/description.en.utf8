<h2>Hevelius</h2>
<p>Johannes Hevelius created a set of 50 exquisite engravings in the 17th century Firmamentum Sobiescianum sive Uranographia.  His star atlas is notable for many reasons. The star positions for the charts were derived from Hevelius's own star catalog (Prodromus astronomiae (1690) which contained 1564 stars and incorporated the first accurate measurements of Southern stars made by Edmond Halley), which was first published along with the atlas. It is unique among the Grand Atlases in choosing to depict the constellations as they would appear on a globe, that is, from the outside looking in, rather than from a geocentric point of view, as Bayer and most others adopted.</p>

<h3>Constellations</h3>
<p>Hevelius's Firmamentum depicts 56 constellations rather that the modern western 88. This atlas introduced 11 new constellations devised by Hevelius</p>
