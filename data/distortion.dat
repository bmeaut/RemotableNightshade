# This file contains fisheye distortion correction parameters 
# and truncated mode configuration for Nightshade.
#
# On the DESKTOP build, lens 1 is always used.
#
# Each distortion definition begins with a lens, height, pconfig line where:
#   lens = lens number
#   height = window height in pixels, or 0 to match any height
#   pconfig = projection configuration:
#      0 = truncated (or default configuration when truncation isn't an option)
#      1 = lens at dome center
#      2 = lens below dome center (such as for projection angles much under 180 degrees)    
#
# Following this is an optional viewport line, of the form:
#   viewport CENTER_X CENTER_Y RADIUS
# If these are between 0 and 1, they are interpreted as fractions of the screen width,
# otherwise as pixel values.  CENTER_Y is measured up from the bottom of the screen.
#
# Following this are distortion correction lines of two types:
#   L = lens distortion
#   G = geometry (projector placement) distortion
#
# Each type has two subtypes (as separate lines)
#   P = project function parameters
#   U = unproject function parameters
#
# parameters are:
#   a, b, c, limit, fudge_factor
#
# where for projection (unit circle):
# 	if (f < limit ) {
#		f = a*f + b*f*f + c*f*f*f;
#	} else {
#		f = f + fudge_factor;
#	}
#
# (see src/fisheye_projector.cpp for implementation details)
#
